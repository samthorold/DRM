## CAPM

### CAPM assumptions

- Investors make their decisions purely on the basis of expected return and variance. So all expected returns, variances and covariances of assets are known.
- Investors are non-satiated and risk-averse.
- There are no taxes or transaction costs.
- Assets may be held in any amount.
- All investors share the same fixed, one-step time horizon.
- All investors share the same assumptions about expected returns, variances and covariances of asstes.
- All investors measure returns consistently (e.g. same currency or real/nominal terms).
- The market is perfect.
- All investors may lend or borrow any amount of a risk-free asset at the same risk-free rate, $r$.

### Results of the CAPM

- All investors share the same efficient frontier of risky assets.
- The efficient frontier collapses to a straight line in $E-\sigma$ space in the presence of a risk-free asset.
- All investors hold a combination of the risk-free asset and the same portfolio of risky assets, $M$.
- $M$ is the market portfolio - it consists of all assets held in proportion to their market capitalisation.

The **separation theorem** suggests that the investor's choice of portfolio of risky assets is independent of their utility function.

**Capital market line**
\[
E_p = r +\frac{\sigma_p}{\sigma_M}(E_m-r)
\]

**Market price of risk**
\[
MPR = \frac{E_m-r}{\sigma_M}
\]

**Security market line**
\[
E_p = r +\beta_p(E_m-r)
\]
where
\[
\beta_p = \frac{Cov(R_p, R_M)}{Var(R_M)}
\]

The main limitations of the basic CAPM are that most of the assumptions are unrealistic
and that empirical studies do not provide strong support for the model.
But, there is some evidence to suggest that a linear relationship between expected return and systemic risk.
