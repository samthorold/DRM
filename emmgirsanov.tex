Changing probabilities from $P$ to $Q$ means $W$ is no longer a standard Weiner
process. We can adjust the Weiner process
\begin{equation} \label{Girsanov}
    d\tilde{W}_t=dW_t+\lambda_tdt
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_tdt$ is a deterministic increment. Under the correct $Q$,
$d\tilde{W}$ can be a standard Weiner process.
The fundamental theorem of asset pricing says that all discounted gains
processes must be $Q$-martingales. So we choose $Q$ to make the gains process
a martingale. We do this by making the drift, $\mu_Y$, equal to $0$. This boils
down to the following steps;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find dynamics of $G^*$ using Ito under probability measure $P$
    \item Change probability measure from $P$ to $Q$ with equation
          \ref{Girsanov}
    \item Choose $\lambda$ to make drift, $\mu$, equal to $0$
\end{enumerate}
