# Behavioural finance

The field of behavioural finance relates to the psychology that underlies and
drives financial decision-making behaviour.

Friedman and Savage approach: individuals are risk-seeking at low levels of
wealth and risk-averse at high levels of wealth.
The most famous critique of expected utility theory is from Kahneman and
Tversky, culminating in _prospect theory_.

## Prospect theory

Prospect theory details how human decision-making differs systematically
from that predicted by expected utility theory.
Further, it states that humans consistently violate the rationality axioms
that form the basis of utility theory.
There are two phases of decision-making in prospect theory;

- Editing/framing: Outcomes are initially appraised and ordered. Behavioural
patterns observed during this phase
    - Acceptance: People are unlikely to alter the formulation of the choices
    presented
    - Segregation: People tend to focus on the most "relevant" factors of a
    problem
- Evaluation: Choise made from appraised outcomes. Behavioural patterns
observed during this phase include
    - Reference dependence: utility curves have inflexion point at reference
    point because investors are more attuned to changes in attributes than
    changes in absolute value
    - **Loss aversion**: investors are more sensitive to losses than gains of
    the same magnitude resulting in utility curves that are steeper for losses
    than for gains
    - Endowment effects: preferences depend on what an investor already has
    - Changing risk attitudes: investors tend to be less risk-averse in domain
    of gains
    - Diminishing sensitivity: as investors gain more, the marginal impact of
    additional gains falls (and vice versa). Utility functions are concave in
    the domain of gains but convex in the domain of losses
    - Probability weighting: low probabilities are often overweighted and vice
    versa
    - Certainty effect: a reduction in probability from 100% has more of an
    impact on utility than an equivalent reduction from a lower probability
    - Isolation effect: investors focus on the differences between options,
    ignoring the similarities.

Prospect theory says that utility is based on gains and losses relative to some
reference point.
People are typically risk-averse when considering gains relative to the
reference point and risk-seeking when considering losses relative to the
reference point.

## Behavioural bias

A _heuristic_ is a shortcut used by the brain to deliver a quick decision.
Examples include

- **Anchoring and adjustment**: investors start with an idea of the answer and
then adjust away to produce the final answer.
The anchor may be from someone else such as an expert and does not have to be
particularly good to be relied upon by investors.
- Representativeness: investors often replace probabilistic thinking with taking
a similar system/situation as a proxy.
It is easier and quicker to use a similar situation than to compute new
probabilities. Can result in using the recent past to gauge decision to invest.
- Availability: probability is equated to ease of remembering examples.
Vivid outcomes are more easily recalled.
- Familiarity: can lead to home country bias when constructing portfolios.

The interaction between system one and system two thinking can lead to
**behavioural biases** that are significant deviations from rational thinking.
They include

- **Overconfidence**, perhaps due to hindsight bias or confirmation bias
- Self-attribution bias: investors credit themselves for gains but blame
external forces for losses
- **Status quo bias**: investors inherently prefer the current situation.
Related to loss aversion and endowment effects.
- Herd behaviour: tendency of investors to mimic the actions of other investors.

## The equity premium puzzle

The _equity premium puzzle_, the fact that the returns from equities exceed the
returns from bonds by more than is predicted by risk aversion alone, can be
explained by **myopic loss aversion** (Benartzi and Thaler, 1995).
Myopic loss aversion suggests that investors are less risk averse when faced
with a multi-period series of gambles.
This is because investors are much more concerned by losses than equivalent
gains leading them to focus on very short-term returns and volatilities rather
than long-run earnings.
Stocks are volatile in the short-term and this may dissuade myopic investors
from buying stocks, unless they are compensated with adequate returns.
The high equity premium seen around the world accounts for risk aversion as well
as aversion to short-term losses.

Basically, investors need to earn additional return on equities to overcome
their aversion to the short-term losses, on top of risk-aversion, typical of
equity investment.

## Example - Behaviour following poor stock returns (ST5 April 2008, Q6)

Consider a risk-averse investor with around 1% of their retirement invested in
the shares of a large bank.
Historically, the bank has been involved in low-risk activities and produced
steady returns.
Since new management three years ago,
the bank has been involved in more risky activities that have gone wrong.
The share price has declined.
The investor had the opportunity to sell the stock six months ago but chose not
to.
Since then, the share price has fallen further.

Why might the investor not have sold the stock?

- Investor expects the share price to rebound
- Share represents only 1% of their total portfolio
- Investor may not follow performance of their shares very closely
- Share may be part of a diversified portfolio
- _Regret aversion_: to avoid regretting a decision to sell had the share price
subsequently risen and/or avoid the regret of crystallising a loss
- _Status quo bias_: investor may have a preference for keeping things as they
are
- _Overconfidence_ in their abilities to predict the future share price
- _Anchoring_: investor may be "attached" to a particular share price and
reluctant to sell below this specific price
- Avoid creating a tax liability
- Share may provide high dividend income
