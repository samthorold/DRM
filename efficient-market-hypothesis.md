# The Efficient Markets Hypothesis

In an _efficient_ security market the price of every security fully reflects all
relevant and available information.
The EMH states that security markets are efficient.
The three forms of EMH are;

- **Weak**: Market prices reflect all of the information contained in
historical price data.
If markets are weak form efficient, technical analysis cannot be used to
generate excess risk-adjusted returns.
- **Semi-strong**: Market prices reflect all publically available information.
If markets are semi-strong form efficient, then fundamental analysis cannot be
used to generate excess risk-adjusted returns.
- **Strong**: Market prices reflect all information, whether or not it is
public.
If markets are strong form efficient, then insider trading cannot be used to
generate excess risk-adjusted returns.

In practice, the level of efficiency depends on whether information is freely
available, which in turn may depend on the level of disclosure required by
regulation.
The importance of market efficiency stems from the fact that if markets are not
efficient then investors with better information may be able to generate
higher risk-adjusted returns.
If markets are efficient, an active investment manager is difficult to justify.

## Tests of the EMH

This is tough and so empirical evidence is inconclusive concerning the extent
to which markets are efficient in practice. But;

- Studies of directors' share dealings suggest that, even with inside
information, it is difficult to out-perform the market.
- Studies have failed to identify a difference between the returns on stocks
selected with technical analysis and those selected purely at random.
- Research has concentrated on the semi-strong form of the EMH and in
particular, tests of informational efficiency and volatility tests.

### Informational efficiency

Studies show that the market overreacts to certain events and underreacts to
other events.
The over/under reaction is corrected over a long time period.
If this is true then investors could take advantage of the slow correction of
the market and efficiency would not hold.

#### Overreaction

- Past winners tend to be future losers and the market appears to overreact to
past performance.
- Certain accounting ratios appear to have predictive powers, an example of the
market apparently overreacting to past growth.
- Firms coming to the market have poor subsequent performance.

#### Underreaction

- Stock prices continue to respond to earnings announcements up to a year after
their announcement.
- Abnormal excess returns for the parent and subsidiary firms following a
de-merger.
- Abnormal negative returns following mergers.

### Volatility tests

Rob Shiller first formulated the claim of "excess volatility" into a testable
proposition in 1981.
He considered a discounted cashflow model of equities going back to 1870.
By using actual dividends paid out and some terminal value for the stock,
he calculated a "perfect foresight" price for the stock, i.e. the "correct"
price for the stock if market participants had been able to predict future
dividends.
The difference between the actual price and the perfect forecast price
represents forecast errors.
If market participants are rational, there should be no systematic
forecast errors.
Further, broad movements in perfect forecast price should correlate with
broad moves in the actual price.

Shiller found strong evidence that the observed level of volatility contradicted
the EMH.
However, subsequent studies using different formulations of the problem found
that the violation of the EMH had only borderline statistical significance.
Criticisms of Shiller's study include;

- Choice of terminal value for the stock price
- Use of a constant discount rate
- Bias in estimates of the variation due to autocorrelation
- Possible non-stationarity of the series, i.e. the series may have stochastic
trends that invalidate the measurements of variance.

## Example - Organising an EMH answer

Discuss the statement _The efficient markets hypothesis states that the market
price is always correct and therefore it is not possible for investors to make
money from investig in shares._

_Prices are always correct..._

EMH states that prices react quickly and accurately to new information, which
can be treated as saying that prices are "correct" in the sense that they factor
in all available information. However, it is important to distinguish between
the different types of information that are factored into prices. This could be
just past price history (weak form) or all publically available information
(semi-strong form) or all information, including privileged information known
only to company directors (strong form).

If the relevant form of EMH applies, it is not possible to make an risk-adjusted
profit based on that category of information. For example, if markets are
weak-form efficient, then technical analysts should not be able to benefit from
their analyses.

_Not possible for shareholders to make money..._

This does not mean that it is not possible to make money by investing in shares.
In the long-term shares are generally believed to offer a higher expected return
than investing in a risk-free asset. However, if the market is efficient, it
should not be possible to outperform other investors who are working from the
same information and within the same constraints.

If additional information is available, higher returns may be possible e.g. if
an investor in a semi-strong form marker has access to insider information
(which may be illegal to make use of) this could provide an advantage. It may
also be possible to pay for more detailed analysis that provides more
information than available to the public.

There has been considerable research into testing whether the markets are indeed
efficient and at what level, but there are difficulties with testing each form.
