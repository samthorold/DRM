# The Efficient Markets Hypothesis

In an _efficient_ security market the price of every security fully reflects all
relevant and available information.
The EMH states that security markets are efficient.
The three forms of EMH are;

- **Weak**: Market prices reflect all of the information contained in
historical price data.
If markets are weak form efficient, technical analysis cannot be used to
generate excess risk-adjusted returns.
- **Semi-strong**: Market prices reflect all publically available information.
If markets are semi-strong form efficient, then fundamental analysis cannot be
used to generate excess risk-adjusted returns.
- **Strong**: Market prices reflect all information, whether or not it is
public.
If markets are strong form efficient, then insider trading cannot be used to
generate excess risk-adjusted returns.

In practice, the level of efficiency depends on whether information is freely
available, which in turn may depend on the level of disclosure required by
regulation.
The importance of market efficiency stems from the fact that if markets are not
efficient then investors with better information may be able to generate
higher risk-adjusted returns.
If markets are efficient, an active investment manager is difficult to justify.

## Tests of the EMH

This is tough and so empirical evidence is inconclusive concerning the extent
to which markets are efficient in practice. But;

- Studies of directors' share dealings suggest that, even with inside
information, it is difficult to out-perform the market.
- Studies have failed to identify a difference between the returns on stocks
selected with technical analysis and those selected purely at random.
- Research has concentrated on the semi-strong form of the EMH and in
particular, tests of informational efficiency and volatility tests.

### Informational efficiency

Studies show that the market overreacts to certain events and underreacts to
other events.
The over/under reaction is corrected over a long time period.
If this is true then investors could take advantage of the slow correction of
the market and efficiency would not hold.

#### Overreaction

- Past winners tend to be future losers and the market appears to overreact to
past performance.
- Certain accounting ratios appear to have predictive powers, an example of the
market apparently overreacting to past growth.
- Firms coming to the market have poor subsequent performance.

#### Underreaction

- Stock prices continue to respond to earnings announcements up to a year after
their announcement.
- Abnormal excess returns for the parent and subsidiary firms following a
de-merger.
- Abnormal negative returns following mergers.

### Volatility tests

Rob Shiller first formulated the claim of "excess volatility" into a testable
proposition in 1981.
He found strong evidence that the observed level of volatility contradicted
the EMH.
However, subsequent studies using different formulations of the problem found
that the violation of the EMH had only borderline statistical significance.
Criticisms of Shiller's study include;

- Choice of terminal value for the stock price
- Use of a constant discount rate
- Bias in estimates of the variation due to autocorrelation
- Possible non-stationarity of the series, i.e. the series may have stochastic
trends that invalidate the measurements of variance.
