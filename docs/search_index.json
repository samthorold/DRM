["the-efficient-markets-hypothesis.html", "1 The Efficient Markets Hypothesis 1.1 Tests of the EMH", " 1 The Efficient Markets Hypothesis In an efficient security market the price of every security fully reflects all relevant and available information. The EMH states that security markets are efficient. The three forms of EMH are; Weak: Market prices reflect all of the information contained in historical price data. If markets are weak form efficient, technical analysis cannot be used to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. Semi-strong: Market prices reflect all publically available information. If markets are semi-strong form efficient, then fundamental analysis cannot be used to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. Strong: Market prices reflect all information, whether or not it is public. If markets are strong form efficient, then insider trading cannot be used to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. In practice, the level of efficiency depends on whether information is freely available, which in turn may depend on the level of disclosure required by regulation. The importance of market efficiency stems from the fact that if markets are not efficient then investors with better information may be able to generate higher risk-adjusted returns. If markets are efficient, an active investment manager is difficult to justify. 1.1 Tests of the EMH This is tough and so empirical evidence is inconclusive concerning the extent to which markets are efficient in practice. But; Studies of directors’ share dealings suggest that, even with inside information, it is difficult to out-perform the market. Studies have failed to identify a difference between the returns on stocks selected with technical analysis and those selected purely at random. Research has concentrated on the semi-strong form of the EMH and in particular, tests of informational efficiency and volatility tests. 1.1.1 Informational efficiency Studies show that the market overreacts to certain events and underreacts to other events. The over/under reaction is corrected over a long time period. If this is true then investors could take advantage of the slow correction of the market and efficiency would not hold. 1.1.1.1 Overreaction Past winners tend to be future losers and the market appears to overreact to past performance. Certain accounting ratios appear to have predictive powers, an example of the market apparently overreacting to past growth. Firms coming to the market have poor subsequent performance. 1.1.1.2 Underreaction Stock prices continue to respond to earnings announcements up to a year after their announcement. Abnormal excess returns for the parent and subsidiary firms following a de-merger. Abnormal negative returns following mergers. 1.1.2 Volatility tests Rob Shiller first formulated the claim of “excess volatility” into a testable proposition in 1981. He found strong evidence that the observed level of volatility contradicted the EMH. However, subsequent studies using different formulations of the problem found that the violation of the EMH had only borderline statistical significance. Criticisms of Shiller’s study include; Choice of terminal value for the stock price Use of a constant discount rate Bias in estimates of the variation due to autocorrelation Possible non-stationarity of the series, i.e. the series may have stochastic trends that invalidate the measurements of variance.

Rational expectations theory – EMH Rational choice – Utility theory Behavioural finance Utility: Satisfaction an individual obtains from a particular course of action. It is a numerical value that can be assigned to each possible value of an investor’s wealth through a utility function. 2.1 Expected utility The expected utility theorem states that a function \\(U(w)\\) can be constructed as representing an investor’s utility of wealth at some future date. Decisions are made in a manner to maximise the expected value of utility given the investor’s particular beliefs about the probability of different outcomes. \\[ E[U(w)] = \\sum_{i=1}^Np(w_i)U(w_i) \\] Note: Expected utility theory is not required in conditions of certainty. In this context, investors aim to maximise utility (not expected utility). 2.1.1 Axioms There are four common axioms; Comparability: An investor can state a preference for all certain outcomes Transitivity: if \\(A&gt;B\\) and \\(B&gt;C\\) then \\(A&gt;C\\). Independence: If an investor is indifferent between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), they are also indifferent between; \\(A\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\), and \\(B\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\). Certainty equivalence: If \\(A&gt;B\\) and \\(B&gt;C\\), there is a unique \\(p\\) such that an investor is indifferent between; \\(A\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\), and \\(B\\). Investors’ preferences are assumed to be influenced by risk. What does a utility function say about an investor’s risk-return preference? 2.2 Utility functions and risk preference Investors are assumed to be non-satiated, \\(U&#39;(W)&gt;0\\), and risk-averse, \\(U&#39;&#39;(w)&lt;0\\). This means they prefer more to less and value a decrease in risk more than an increase in risk of the same amount. But how does an investor’s risk aversion change with the level of wealth? Absolute risk aversion measures an investor’s aversion to risk. Relative risk aversion measures an investor’s aversion to risk relative to their wealth. \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{U&#39;&#39;(w)}{U&#39;(w)} \\] \\[ R(w)=-w\\frac{U&#39;&#39;(w)}{U&#39;(w)}=wA(w) \\] 2.3 Forms of utility function Three common forms of utility function are; Quadratic: \\(U(w)=a+bw+cw^2\\) or \\(U(w)=w+dw^2\\) (where \\(d&lt;0\\)) \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{2d}{1+2dw} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=\\frac{4d^2}{(1+2dw)^2}&gt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=-\\frac{2dw}{1+2dw} \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=-\\frac{2d}{(1+2dw)^2}&gt;0 \\] The quadratic utility function has increasing absolute and relative risk aversion. Log: \\(U(w)=ln(w)\\) \\[ A(w)=\\frac{1}{w} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=-\\frac{1}{w^2}&lt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=1 \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=0 \\] The log utility function has decreasing absolute and constant relative risk aversion. While an investor is less concerned with the absolute value of risk as their wealth increases, the value of risk remains a constant percentage of their wealth. Power: \\(U(w)=\\frac{w^\\gamma -1}{\\gamma}\\) \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma^2}&lt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=-(\\gamma -1) \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=0 \\] The power utility function is one of a wider class of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion functions. \\(\\gamma\\) is the risk aversion coefficient. The power function has decreasing absolute and constant relative risk aversion. While an investor is less concerned with the absolute value of risk as their wealth increases, the value of risk remains a constant percentage of their wealth. None of the utility functions above allow much freedom to calibrate the function to reflect individual investor preferences. Further, it may not be possible to model utility over all levels of wealth with a single function. 2.4 State-dependent utility functions State-dependent utility functions can be used to model changes in the utility functions at different levels of wealth. For example, a firm will be highly risk averse at levels of wealth close to insolvency. States for individuals that may influence the form of a utility functions could be healthy/sick or married/single. To construct a utility function in practice, we may ask individuals a series of questions and try to fit a line to their answers, keeping in mind the axioms and principles of non-satiation and risk-aversion. 2.5 Maximising utility with insurance Buying insurance will diminish the wealth of an individual, but it may increase utility. A risk-averse person will pay more for insurance than the long-run average value of claims. This means buying insurance is worthwhile for the individual even if the insurer adds a premium to the expected value of claims to make a profit. An insurance contract is feasible if the minimum premium the insurer is willing to offer less than the maximum premium the individual is willing to pay for insurance. The maximum premium, \\(P\\), an individual is willing to pay to insure against a random loss, \\(X\\), is given by \\[ E[U(a-X)]=U(a-P) \\] where \\(a\\) is the initial level of wealth. The minimum premium, \\(Q\\), an insurer is willing to offer to insure a random loss, \\(X\\), is given by \\[ E[U(a+Q-X)]=U(a) \\] where \\(a\\) is the initial level of wealth. 2.6 Limitations Expected utility is good at focusing us on the trade-offs involved in risky decisions. But; Calculating expected utility is hard. What is the shape of someone’s utility function? Normally we have to settle for modelling a general feature such as risk aversion Applying to several sets of risky decisions is hard. Considering the utility function of a firm is even harder than that of an individual. Expected utility theory is not good at modelling interdependence of risks. 2.7 Alternative decision rules Mean-variance Stochastic dominance Behavioural finance – non-rational investment behaviour "],
["behavioural-finance.html", "3 Behavioural finance 3.1 Prospect theory 3.2 Behavioural bias 3.3 The equity premium puzzle 3.4 Example - Behaviour following poor stock returns (ST5 April 2008, Q6)", " 3 Behavioural finance The field of behavioural finance relates to the psychology that underlies and drives financial decision-making behaviour. Friedman and Savage approach: individuals are risk-seeking at low levels of wealth and risk-averse at high levels of wealth. The most famous critique of expected utility theory is from Kahneman and Tversky, culminating in prospect theory. 3.1 Prospect theory Prospect theory details how human decision-making differs systematically from that predicted by expected utility theory. Further, it states that humans consistently violate the rationality axioms that form the basis of utility theory. There are two phases of decision-making in prospect theory; Editing/framing: Outcomes are initially appraised and ordered. Behavioural patterns observed during this phase Acceptance: People are unlikely to alter the formulation of the choices presented Segregation: People tend to focus on the most “relevant” factors of a problem Evaluation: Choise made from appraised outcomes. Behavioural patterns observed during this phase include Reference dependence: utility curves have inflexion point at reference point because investors are more attuned to changes in attributes than changes in absolute value Loss aversion: investors are more sensitive to losses than gains of the same magnitude resulting in utility curves that are steeper for losses than for gains Endowment effects: preferences depend on what an investor already has Changing risk attitudes: investors tend to be less risk-averse in domain of gains Diminishing sensitivity: as investors gain more, the marginal impact of additional gains falls (and vice versa). Utility functions are concave in the domain of gains but convex in the domain of losses Probability weighting: low probabilities are often overweighted and vice versa Certainty effect: a reduction in probability from 100% has more of an impact on utility than an equivalent reduction from a lower probability Isolation effect: investors focus on the differences between options, ignoring the similarities. Prospect theory says that utility is based on gains and losses relative to some reference point. People are typically risk-averse when considering gains relative to the reference point and risk-seeking when considering losses relative to the reference point. 3.2 Behavioural bias A heuristic is a shortcut used by the brain to deliver a quick decision. Examples include Anchoring and adjustment: investors start with an idea of the answer and then adjust away to produce the final answer. The anchor may be from someone else such as an expert and does not have to be particularly good to be relied upon by investors. Representativeness: investors often replace probabilistic thinking with taking a similar system/situation as a proxy. It is easier and quicker to use a similar situation than to compute new probabilities. Can result in using the recent past to gauge decision to invest. Availability: probability is equated to ease of remembering examples. Vivid outcomes are more easily recalled. Familiarity: can lead to home country bias when constructing portfolios. The interaction between system one and system two thinking can lead to behavioural biases that are significant deviations from rational thinking. They include Overconfidence, perhaps due to hindsight bias or confirmation bias Self-attribution bias: investors credit themselves for gains but blame external forces for losses Status quo bias: investors inherently prefer the current situation. Related to loss aversion and endowment effects. Herd behaviour: tendency of investors to mimic the actions of other investors. 3.3 The equity premium puzzle The equity premium puzzle, the fact that the returns from equities exceed the returns from bonds by more than is predicted by risk aversion alone, can be explained by myopic loss aversion (Benartzi and Thaler, 1995). Myopic loss aversion suggests that investors are less risk averse when faced with a multi-period series of gambles. This is because investors are much more concerned by losses than equivalent gains leading them to focus on very short-term returns and volatilities rather than long-run earnings. Stocks are volatile in the short-term and this may dissuade myopic investors from buying stocks, unless they are compensated with adequate returns. The high equity premium seen around the world accounts for risk aversion as well as aversion to short-term losses. Basically, investors need to earn additional return on equities to overcome their aversion to the short-term losses, on top of risk-aversion, typical of equity investment. 3.4 Example - Behaviour following poor stock returns (ST5 April 2008, Q6) Consider a risk-averse investor with around 1% of their retirement invested in the shares of a large bank. Historically, the bank has been involved in low-risk activities and produced steady returns. Since new management three years ago, the bank has been involved in more risky activities that have gone wrong. The share price has declined. The investor had the opportunity to sell the stock six months ago but chose not to. Since then, the share price has fallen further. Why might the investor not have sold the stock? Investor expects the share price to rebound Share represents only 1% of their total portfolio Investor may not follow performance of their shares very closely Share may be part of a diversified portfolio Regret aversion: to avoid regretting a decision to sell had the share price subsequently risen and/or avoid the regret of crystallising a loss Status quo bias: investor may have a preference for keeping things as they are Overconfidence in their abilities to predict the future share price Anchoring: investor may be “attached” to a particular share price and reluctant to sell below this specific price Avoid creating a tax liability Share may provide high dividend income "],

It is often calculated assuming investment returns follow a normal distribution, which may not be appropriate. Continuous random varianble: \\(VaR(X)=-t\\) where \\(P(X=x)=p\\). Discrete random varianble: \\(VaR(X)=-t\\) where \\(t=max(x:P(X&lt;x)\\le p)\\) 4.5 Expected shortfall Continuous random varianble: \\(Var=\\int_{-\\infty}^L(L-x)f(x)dx\\) Discrete random varianble: \\(Var=\\sum_{x&lt;L}(L-x)P(X=x)\\) Expected shortfall measures are useful for monitoring a fund’s exposure to risk because underperformance to a bench mark is easy to understand. When \\(L\\) is the VaR with a particular confidence level, the expected shortfall is known at TailVaR. TailVaR measures the expected loss in excess of the VaR. It is also possible to calculate the expected shortfall and tailVaR conditional on a shortfall occurring by dividing through by the shortfall probability. 4.6 Risk measures and utility If expected return and variance are used as the basis of investment decisions, it can be shown that this is equivalent to a quadratic utility function. If expected return and semi-variance below the expected return are used as the basis of investment decisions, it can be shown this is equivalent to a utility function that is quadtratic below the expected return and linear above. Use of a shortfall risk measure corresponds to a utility function that has a discontinuity at the minimum required return. 4.7 Using insurance to manage risk Insurers decide which events to offer protection for based on the frequency and severity of the event. Low risk, low liklihood events are not a problem Low risk, high liklihood events must be monitored to prevent problems due to an accumulation of these events high risk, low liklihood events are normally insured high risk, high liklihood events should be avoided. Micro-insurance has increased the number of low risk events being insured. For example, mobiles on holiday. The pooling of resources can be used to reduce an insurer’s risk. Adverse selection describes the fact that people who know that they are bad risks are more inclined to take out insurance than those who know they are good risks. Insurers will try to find out as much about a person as possible to prevent risks being inaccurately measured. Moral hazard is the change in a policy holder’s behaviour once insurance has been taken out, which means the event is more likely to occur. "],

Working backwards, the steps are; Show that a certain portfolio replicates the derivative at all times Looking at the definition of a replicating strategy, we see that we first need a self-financing portfolio Looking at the definition of a self-financing portfolio, we see that we need the holdings in the portfolio to be pre-visible To show a process is pre-visible, we have the martingale representation theorem But, the martingale representation theorem requires two martingales The discounted share price process is a \\(Q\\)-martingale but we need one more The other martingale is constructed from derivative payoff, discounting this all the way back, past the current time \\(t\\), to time 0. This is a replicating strategies approach to price derivative. 7.1 Definitions Pre-visible: Known based on information up to but not including time \\(t\\). Sometimes known as \\(F_{t^-}\\) measurable. For the binomial model, \\(t^-=t-1\\). Complete market: For any derivative payment \\(X\\), there is a replicating strategy, \\((\\phi_t, \\psi_t)\\). Equivalent measure: Two measures \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are equivalent if for any event, \\(E\\), \\(P(E)&gt;0\\) iff \\(Q(E)&gt;0\\). Bascially, both measures must agree what is and what is not possible. Self-financing strategy: A strategy is self-financing is there are no cash inflows or outflows. Replicating strategy: A self-financing strategy for \\(0\\le t&lt;u\\) such that \\(V_u = \\phi_u S_u+\\psi_uB_u=X\\). For an initial investment \\(V_0\\) at \\(t=0\\) if we follow the self-financing strategy we will reproduce the derivative payoff without risk. We rebalance to have \\(\\phi_t\\) units of stock and \\(\\psi_t\\) uints of cash without any inflow or outflow. The replicating strategy gives the derivative payoff regardless of the value of \\(S_u\\). 7.2 Cameron-Martin-Girsanov Helps us with change of measure in ECO423 – \\(d\\tilde{Z}_t=dW_t+\\lambda dt\\). Suppose \\(Z_t\\) is a standard Brownian motion under \\(P\\). Further, suppose \\(\\gamma_t\\) is a pre-visible process. Then there exists a measure \\(Q\\) equivalent to \\(P\\) and where \\[ \\tilde{Z}_t = Z_t + \\int_0^t\\gamma_sds \\] is a standard Brownian motion under \\(Q\\). Conversely, if \\(Z_t\\) is a standard Brownian motion under \\(P\\) and if \\(Q\\) is equivalent to \\(P\\) then there exists a pre-visible process \\(\\gamma_t\\) such that \\[ \\tilde{Z}_t = Z_t + \\int_0^t\\gamma_sds \\] The CMG theorem tells us that we can change the drift but not the volatility of Brownian motion. So if we know \\(P\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) then we can get \\(Q\\). Similarly, if we know \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) we can get \\(\\gamma_t\\). For geometric Brownian motion, \\(\\gamma=\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\). This is the Sharpe ratio. 7.3 Martingale representation theorem Suppose \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) are martingales under \\(P\\). The MRT says there exists a pre-visible process \\(\\phi_t\\) such that \\[ Y_t=Y_0+\\int_0^t\\phi_sdX_s\\iff dY_t=\\phi_tdX_t \\] We’ll see later that \\(\\phi_t\\) is the amount of stock to hold in the replicating portfolio. To make this a replicating portfolio, it is imperative that the amount of stock to hold is pre-visible. The MRT proves that it is. Happy days. "]
