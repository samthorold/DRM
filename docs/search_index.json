Rational expectations theory – EMH Rational choice – Utility theory Behavioural finance Utility: Satisfaction an individual obtains from a particular course of action. It is a numerical value that can be assigned to each possible value of an investor’s wealth through a utility function. Individuals act in a way that maximises \\(U(W)\\). 2.1 Axioms There are four common axioms; Comparability: An investor can state a preference for all certain outcomes Transitivity: if \\(A&gt;B\\) and \\(B&gt;C\\) then \\(A&gt;C\\). Independence: If an investor is indifferent between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), they are also indifferent between; \\(A\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\), and \\(B\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\). Certainty equivalence: If \\(A&gt;B\\) and \\(B&gt;C\\), there is a unique \\(p\\) such that an investor is indifferent between; \\(A\\) with liklihood \\(p\\) and \\(C\\) with liklihood \\(1-p\\), and \\(B\\). Investors’ preferences are assumed to be influenced by risk. What does a utility function say about an investor’s risk-return preference? 2.2 Utility functions and risk preference Investors are assumed to be non-satiated, \\(U&#39;(W)&gt;0\\), and risk-averse, \\(U&#39;&#39;(w)&lt;0\\). This means they prefer more to less and value a decrease in risk more than an increase in risk of the same amount. But how does an investor’s risk aversion change with the level of wealth? Absolute risk aversion measures an investor’s aversion to risk. Relative risk aversion measures an investor’s aversion to risk relative to their wealth. \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{U&#39;&#39;(w)}{U&#39;(w)} \\] \\[ R(w)=-w\\frac{U&#39;&#39;(w)}{U&#39;(w)}=wA(w) \\] 2.3 Forms of utility function Three common forms of utility function are; Quadratic: \\(U(w)=a+bw+cw^2\\) or \\(U(w)=w+dw^2\\) (where \\(d&lt;0\\)) \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{2d}{1+2dw} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=\\frac{4d^2}{(1+2dw)^2}&gt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=-\\frac{2dw}{1+2dw} \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=-\\frac{2d}{(1+2dw)^2}&gt;0 \\] The quadratic utility function has increasing absolute and relative risk aversion. Log: \\(U(w)=ln(w)\\) \\[ A(w)=\\frac{1}{w} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=-\\frac{1}{w^2}&lt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=1 \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=0 \\] The log utility function has decreasing absolute and constant relative risk aversion. While an investor is less concerned with the absolute value of risk as their wealth increases, the value of risk remains a constant percentage of their wealth. Power: \\(U(w)=\\frac{w^\\gamma -1}{\\gamma}\\) \\[ A(w)=-\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma} \\text{ and } A&#39;(w)=\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma^2}&lt;0 \\] \\[ R(w)=-(\\gamma -1) \\text{ and } R&#39;(w)=0 \\] The power utility function is one of a wider class of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion functions. \\(\\gamma\\) is the risk aversion coefficient. The power function has decreasing absolute and constant relative risk aversion. While an investor is less concerned with the absolute value of risk as their wealth increases, the value of risk remains a constant percentage of their wealth. None of the utility functions above allow much freedom to calibrate the function to reflect individual investor preferences. Further, it may not be possible to model utility over all levels of wealth with a single function. 2.4 State-dependent utility functions State-dependent utility functions can be used to model changes in the utility functions at different levels of wealth. For example, a firm will be highly risk averse at levels of wealth close to insolvency. States for individuals that may influence the form of a utility functions could be healthy/sick or married/single. To construct a utility function in practice, we may ask individuals a series of questions and try to fit a line to their answers, keeping in mind the axioms and principles of non-satiation and risk-aversion. 2.5 Maximising utility with insurance Buying insurance will diminish the wealth of an individual, but it may increase utility. A risk-averse person will pay more for insurance than the long-run average value of claims. This means buying insurance is worthwhile for the individual even if the insurer adds a premium to the expected value of claims to make a profit. An insurance contract is feasible if the minimum premium the insurer is willing to offer less than the maximum premium the individual is willing to pay for insurance. The maximum premium, \\(P\\), an individual is willing to pay to insure against a random loss, \\(X\\), is given by \\[ E[U(a-X)]=U(a-P) \\] where \\(a\\) is the initial level of wealth. The minimum premium, \\(Q\\), an insurer is willing to offer to insure a random loss, \\(X\\), is given by \\[ E[U(a+Q-X)]=U(a) \\] where \\(a\\) is the initial level of wealth. 2.6 Limitations Expected utility is good at focusing us on the trade-offs involved in risky decisions. But; Calculating expected utility is hard. What is the shape of someone’s utility function? Normally we have to settle for modelling a general feature such as risk aversion Applying to several sets of risky decisions is hard. Considering the utility function of a firm is even harder than that of an individual. Expected utility theory is not good at modelling interdependence of risks. 2.7 Alternative decision rules Mean-variance Stochastic dominance Behavioural finance – non-rational investment behaviour "],
